CONSIDER DELETING ENTIRE BACKEND AND REPLACING WITH RAILS API; should probably fix issues or help debug them

1. Make login function (query at a specific endpoint)
2. Once login function made, fix "user_id = 10" on post requests
3. Remove all unnecessary console logs and comments from every page (front and back end)
4. Change title font (I meant the title that says "sketch 11" at the top of the tab)
