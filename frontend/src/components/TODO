CONSIDER DELETING ENTIRE BACKEND AND REPLACING WITH RAILS API; should probably fix issues or help debug them

1. Make login function (query at a specific endpoint)
2. Once login function made, fix "user_id = 10" on post requests
3. Make css look nicer for post page (the add tags button spacing with the submit is ugly)
4. Remove all unnecessary console logs and comments from every page (front and back end)
5. Add github link in footer?
6. Change title font
7. Add "my account" page?
