Hello! Are you or somebody you know an artist that believes they deserve recognition? Do you want to make your artwork known to the world, or perhaps just to the people who might want to buy it? Or are you simply a fan of art who wants to discover talented artists of all levels? If you answered yes to any of those questions, Sketch 11 may be the site for you!

Sketch 11 allows you to search for art by title, medium, or tags. This site is a great tool for artists to have their work discovered; if a person sees a particular art piece or style that they like, they can contact the artist for more information. The artists may add a price or select "price negotiable" and they'll be contacted via the email that they provide. There is also a new option to update whether they're open to commissions or not.
